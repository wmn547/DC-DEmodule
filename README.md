# DC-DEmodule
DC&DEmodule is a software program for integrating differential co-expression (DC) and differential expression (DE) analyses and combining information from multiple disease/normal expression datasets to identify disease-related gene co-expression modules that include activated modules (gaining co-expression and up-regulated in disease) and dysfunctional modules (losing co-expression and down-regulated in disease). DC&DEmodule has two key modules: first, for each dataset, using weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to identify co-expression gene modules for disease and normal samples, respectively; second, identifying the significantly DC modules and significantly DE modules.
